# Discord.js V14 handler made in Typescript

So... yeah, i made a basic discord.js handler in TS

## Instructions

1. Create a `.env` file with the following properties

```env
TOKEN=TOKEN,
CLIENT_ID=CLIENTID
```

2. Launch your bot by running `npm run start` or `yarn start`

### Notes
* I recommend you to read the help files located in the [docs](/docs/) folder
* All your commands are registered every time you run the bot
* I like you :flushed:

If you would like to add something to the handler please make a [pull request](https://github.com/elnexreal/discord-ts-handler/compare)
